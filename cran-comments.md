# Reverse Dependency Checks
- checks for {parcats} are now failing
- updates are necessary to ensure compatibility with ggplot 4.0.0
- {parcats} is also maintained by me (Bjoern Koneswarakantha), I have already
  prepared a compatible version and will submit it to CRAN after easyalluvial is
  updated on CRAN
